# SAS-Programming-Projects
I recently took the Coursera SAS programming course and completed the two case studies. The completes course has 3 modules each of which will take 6 months to complete. I knocked all 3 out in 1 week. The case study in the final module "Practical SAS Programming and Certification Review SAS" was what I found most interesting. There were

1. The TSA Travel Case Study
2. The Toursim Case Study. 

Attached are the SAS Codes for both case studies.
